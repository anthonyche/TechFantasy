00:01,The Future of Reasoning
00:03,Hey Vsauce!
00:04,Michael here.
00:05,Where is your mind?
00:07,Is it in your head?
00:10,"I mean, that’s where your brain is — and your brain remembers, plans, makes judgements,"
00:17,solves problems … but you also remember and plan with things like these and this.
00:25,"And you solve problems and make judgements with all sorts of other stuff, too."
00:33,"The more you think about it, the more you realize that while the brain is a wet lump"
00:40,"of fat and protein, no firmer than a glob of tofu, the MIND is something much larger:"
00:48,it’s an ever-expanding organ of tissue AND wood and stone and steel.
00:53,And people.
00:55,Because of communication we can even make OTHER PEOPLE extensions of our minds.
01:02,We can access their memories and perceptions and knowledge by simply asking.
01:07,Or not.
01:09,I don’t need to learn how to fix a car AND practice medicine AND vulcanize rubber OR
01:14,remember everything … other people are doing that for me just as I do things for them.
01:20,We are a species of individuals that is also one big interdependent lumbering growth.
01:27,A frantic blur of flesh and concrete.
01:31,A ‘techno sapien’ powered by imaginations and passions made real by a hallowed faculty
01:38,we call REASON.
01:39,"Reason, it is said, guides us to truer knowledge and better decisions."
01:45,"It’s allowed us to increase life-expectancy, suffer less, work together better, and it’s"
01:51,bound to take us further and higher until the end of time.
01:56,Or is it?
01:58,"The organ we USE to reason takes millions of years to evolve, but the fruits of reason"
02:05,grow rapidly and are ever accelerating.
02:08,"In the next four decades, we’re expected to build the equivalent of another new york"
02:13,city every month
02:15,More concrete was installed in the last two decades outside the US than the US installed
02:22,during the entire 20th century.
02:25,This growth means that quality of life around the world is rising.
02:29,"It means that electricity, manufactured goods, food, comfort and transportation are all becoming"
02:35,more common and accessible.
02:38,But there are hints that reason and logic are struggling aginst the complexity of it
02:44,all; against our growing dependence on the things we’ve built and their unintended
02:50,consequences.
02:52,Nearly every part of life as we know it today involves or relies on a process that releases
02:59,molecules with lopsided electrical charges.
03:02,"This property causes them to absorb and re-emit thermal radiation, pinging it around so that"
03:08,it escapes into space more slowly.
03:11,Having more warmer parcels of air means stronger weather events.
03:15,"They can’t be pinned on any particular extreme storm, but they make extreme storms in general"
03:21,more extreme and frequent.
03:23,"What’s a stake isn’t just ‘bad weather’ it’s disaster: it’s more lives lost, more"
03:29,"property lost, it’s more droughts, more hunger, more famine, more people needing refuge,"
03:34,and a even greater reliance on the very things that caused the problems in the first place.
03:40,"In total, we release about 51 billion tons of such gases every year and we need to release"
03:48,zero.
03:50,But how do you re-think … everything?
03:56,Who gets to direct the costs and tradeoffs?
04:00,How do you achieve collaboration between nearly every local and national government when what
04:05,"works in one place won’t work everywhere, when decisions effect jobs in one place and"
04:11,food in another.
04:12,"When not just things need to be re-thought, but also habits and traditions and values."
04:19,"How do you achieve consensus when a problem isn’t obvious to the senses, is far away"
04:25,"in space and time, requires solutions that affect people in different ways, and as a"
04:30,"product of science, always carries some uncertainty?"
04:36,The philosopher Timothy Morton calls something so massively distributed in time and space
04:42,"and so viscous — so STICKY that it adheres to all that touch it, a HYPEROBJECT."
04:50,Every civilizations that grows at the speed of reason must at some point face hyperobjects.
04:56,"In fact, the fact that we still haven’t found evidence of intelligent life beyond"
05:02,"Earth has been brought up as evidence that some sort of GREAT FILTER, might exist that"
05:07,few civilizations manage to get past.
05:12,That a hyperobject like our impact on the planet might be such a great filter is not
05:19,a new idea.
05:20,What it’ll take to solve it is the topic of Bill Gate’s HOW TO AVOID A CLIMATE DISASTER.
05:26,And I decided to do this video in partnership with him and his team because the way we deal
05:31,with hyperobjects reveals a lot about the mind.
05:35,It’s easy — and common! — to think that we would all be better off if everyone was
05:40,just more rational.
05:43,But what if reasoning wasn’t built for what we’ve become?
05:48,Let’s begin by looking at behavioral inertia.
05:53,Behavioral inertia is the tendency to keep doing what you’re already doing.
05:57,Status quo bias.
05:59,"It can be a frustrating bias if you desire change, but its origin isn’t a flaw."
06:04,If an organism has managed to survive long enough to reproduce and provide and care for
06:10,"its offspring, then the state of its world, was sufficient for its genes to spread."
06:16,That’s all it takes to persist.
06:18,The types of organisms we see around us will naturally be those that managed to persist
06:24,"and didn’t, after reaching the point at which they could persist, rock the boat too"
06:27,much.
06:29,Behavioral inertia can help slow down the accumulation of unintended consequences and
06:35,"the loss of ideas that work, but it can also slow down innovation and adaptation."
06:42,"If the environmental impacts of our society were more immediate and un-ignorable, it wouldn’t"
06:49,be so tempting to apply this inertial brake.
06:52,But emissions are invisible and their consequences aren’t immediate or local.
06:59,They impact future people and people far away.
07:02,"Those who are different from us, poorer than us, people we will never meet."
07:07,This may be one of the first challenges advancing civilizations face: weilding not just the
07:13,"power of technology and distributed cognition, but also the responsibilities."
07:19,Extending not just the mind but also EMPATHY could certainly be a great filter.
07:28,"Our lower instincts may bias us, but surely, REASON can help us navigate towards the future"
07:34,"we want, right?"
07:36,"Well, what IS reason?"
07:38,It’s a way of making inferences.
07:41,An inference is any new information extracted from the information you already have.
07:48,We make inferences all the time — every living thing does.
07:54,"We don’t have measuring-tape tentacles that shoot from our eyes, and what actually enters"
07:59,"our brain is just a 2D image, but our brains nonetheless INFER depth by attending to cues"
08:06,"like stereopsis, occultation, perspective, parallax, size…"
08:10,"When this happens, we accept it as reality."
08:15,We aren’t aware of the visual processing that made it possible and don’t have to
08:20,be.
08:21,"If, however, we do consciously consider WHY a certain conclusion was reached, then BOOM"
08:27,that’s REASONING.
08:28,"Reasoning is the process of making inferences not automatically and instrinctively, but"
08:34,by looking at facts and seeing what conclusion they support.
08:39,When Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth to within a percentage or two
08:43,"of the value accepted today, he didn’t do it by MEASURING the Earth and he didn’t"
08:48,"just percieve it as self-evident, he INFERRED it from what he knew about shadows and how"
08:55,long it took camels to move.
08:57,Stories like that make it easy to believe that reasoning evolved because it supercharged
09:02,"our abilities; it clearly moves us towards truer conclusions, better decisions, and knowledge"
09:09,no other species could infer.
09:12,"Attempts to describe the rules of good, orderly reason, became logic and mathematics, concepts"
09:19,"so general and abstract that while we were still animals, armed with them, we were no"
09:26,longer beasts.
09:27,"But that’s the rub, isn’t it?"
09:31,"If reasoning is so great, why are we the only species with such a sophisticated grasp of"
09:37,it?
09:38,"And if its purpose is truth and good judgement, why don’t we all agree on everything?"
09:44,These questions make up what Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber call the Enigma of Reason.
09:46,"It’s tempting to think that disagreements happen because while I’M being rational,"
09:52,those who disagree with me are being irrational.
09:54,Urgh!
09:55,If only people would use reason and logic.
09:58,What’s happened to the world!
10:00,"That’s a fair complaint if you’re arguing over logic puzzles, but the world is not a"
10:07,logic puzzle.
10:09,"this, however, is:"
10:11,Paul is looking at Mary.
10:14,Mary is looking at Peter.
10:16,Paul is married.
10:18,Peter is unmarried.
10:19,Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?
10:24,Yes.
10:25,No.
10:26,Or not enough information to decide?
10:29,think about it.
10:32,The answer is YES.
10:35,"You may have thought there’s no way to know, because we don’t know if Mary is married."
10:40,But she either is or she isn’t.
10:43,"And if she IS, then she, a married person, is looking at Peter, an unmarried person."
10:49,"If she ISN’T then Paul, a married person, is looking at her, an unmarried person."
10:56,"No matter what Mary’s deal is, the answer will be YES."
11:01,"When people get this puzzle wrong and the correct answer is explained to them, they"
11:05,almost always immedaitely see why it’s right and change their mind.
11:11,Life is not usually like that.
11:13,"Now, take a look at this logical syllogism:"
11:17,All elephants are awesome.
11:20,Michael is an elephant.
11:23,"Therefore, Michael is awesome."
11:25,This conclusion is logically valid.
11:27,But it’s not SOUND.
11:28,"The conclusion follows from these assumptions, but are these assumptions true?"
11:32,No.
11:33,I am NOT an elephant.
11:37,"Also, this premise … is subjective."
11:40,What does it MEAN to be awesome?
11:42,Can you measure it with an awesome-ometer?
11:45,"So you can see why, when analyzing something like our impact on the planet, logic can only"
11:50,be a partial tool.
11:53,"If some people have more to lose than others, who gets to decide which are fair?"
11:59,"Still, though, it would seem that reasoning should be able help out here."
12:04,"If each of us would just attend to ONLY the facts, surely we’d all recognize the same,"
12:12,reasonable approach.
12:13,"Problem is, that’s not how reasoning works."
12:18,"Since the scientific study of human reasoning began about a hundred years ago, it’s been"
12:23,"found again and again that we’re not only BAD at reasoning, lazy and biased, but almost"
12:31,seem PROGRAMMED to be bad.
12:34,Like the flaws are intentional…
12:36,In an episode of Mind Field I once used a magician to pull off a little experiment.
12:42,He asked people to look at two faces and choose which of the two they would prefer to work
12:48,"with, placing their preferences in one pile, and those they rejected into another."
12:53,"Then, the pile of people they picked were shown again and each person was asked to provide"
12:59,a REASON for why they chose that person.
13:02,"But with a little slight of hand, the magician managed to sneak in some of the faces they"
13:07,had just rejected.
13:08,"Amazingly, the majority of people didn’t even notice the trick."
13:13,"Not only that, they were able to effortlessly explain the reasons behind their choice — a"
13:19,choice they never actually made.
13:23,"Remembering faces you’ve only seen briefly isn’t the easiest thing to do, but other"
13:27,studies have shown that even if the task involves answering questions about one’s political
13:32,beliefs — things we would seemingly have a firmer grasp on — still nearly half of
13:37,participants will fail to notice that answers they gave have been reversed when they’re
13:43,later asked to explain them.
13:46,"Point is, we seem practically BUILT to give reasons for whatever we think we must, and"
13:52,NOT the reasons we actually used to reach a conclusion.
13:56,What if we don’t even USE reasons to form our beliefs?
14:02,Let’s talk about INTUITIONS.
14:05,Our brains have evolved over millions of years to react to the world around us in brilliant
14:10,ways with little to no input from us.
14:12,"For example, when you notice that someone is upset, you’ve don’t consciously think,"
14:18,"“ok, so their eyebrows and oriented like that, their speaking is curt, their posture"
14:24,… hmmmm … ah ha! those are reasons to conclude that they are upset!”
14:29,"Instead, the belief that they may be upset was just apparent."
14:34,You intuited it.
14:36,You ‘know’ it without exactly know HOW you exactly you came to know it.
14:41,The mood recognizing parts of your brain operate in a way that is opaque to your awareness.
14:47,"BUT if someone asks you, why you think they’re upset, you can nonetheless produce all sorts"
14:54,of reasons — some may have been the ones your brain actually attended to.
14:58,But they’re all just guesses.
15:01,"Instead of using reasoning to COME to conclusions, we use conclusions to come to reasons."
15:09,"To be fair, we CAN go the other way."
15:11,"We love puzzles and when we don’t have a strong intuition either way, we can sit down"
15:15,and mull over various reason to think one thing or another.
15:19,Our love of puzzles suggests that reasoning has a survival value.
15:24,Organisms that found it pleasurable would be more likely to use it.
15:27,"But when we reason alone, even when we have no motivation to reach any particular conclusion,"
15:33,we STILL exhibit deep biases that seem less like mistakes and more like features.
15:40,"For example, it’s been shown that between two otherwise similar products, people will"
15:45,"prefer to buy the one with more features — even if they don’t want those features, never"
15:50,"plan to use them, and think they’re all pointless and over complicated."
15:54,Why?
15:55,Well it might be that we find such decisions easier to justify … to OTHERS.
16:02,We won’t feel embarrassed if someone criticizes us for getting fewer features.
16:08,"After decades of findings like this, Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber began to hypothesize"
16:14,"that reasoning to help us make better decisions, but instead, to help us make social decisions."
16:22,Humans inhabit a cognitive niche on this planet.
16:25,"We aren’t strong or sharp or hidden or venomous, instead, our advantage comes from cognition:"
16:32,reasoning and cooperation.
16:34,"We can plan hunt, build traps, and engage in coordinated strategies that can be tested"
16:39,"and modified on the fly, not by millennia of evolution."
16:44,Reasons allow us to so those things.
16:47,It’s hard to convince people that your intuitions are true.
16:50,"But if you can give REASONS for them, its a whole heck of a lot easier to convince other"
16:54,people that you’re right.
16:59,Reason also allows us to justify ourselves in the eyes of others.
17:06,"To explain who we are and express the kinds of reasons we like, what other people can"
17:11,"expect from us, and what we will likely expect from them."
17:15,This social theory of reasoning helps explain why two people can earnestly and rationally
17:22,arrive at different views.
17:23,They each have their own unique brain and values and dispositions and experiences and
17:29,THAT’S what drove their thinking.
17:31,"The reasons they give may or may not be the REAL reasons they came to their conclusions,"
17:36,but it’s the best anyone can do.
17:39,The social theory also explains why people tend to give such weak reasons for their beliefs
17:45,at first or when their intended audience doesn’t need much convincing.
17:49,It would be a waste of time and cognitive reasources to construct grand slam reasons
17:55,for everything I said and did and thought when it wasn’t necessary.
18:00,"Instead, I can off-load some of the work to other people."
18:04,"If I say, “I want to have lunch at ABC Burgers” my friend might say, “ah, no thanks, I had"
18:12,"burgers yesterday” and I might reply back, “oh well that’s no problem, they also"
18:17,have hot dogs and great salads”
18:20,"But if my friend said “ah, no thanks, I’m trying to spend less money eating out this"
18:25,"month” I might reply, “oh well ABC Burgers is really cheap and I;ve got a coupon!”"
18:32,What’s going on there is that I’m providing reasons only as my interlocutor presses for
18:37,them.
18:38,"If they press harder and harder, my reasons will become better and better until either"
18:42,"I win them over, or we come to some different, more harmonious decision."
18:47,"So when people appear to be lazy reasoners or to have bad reasons or none at all, it’s"
18:54,usually just the case that they’re using reason as it evolved to function; socially.
19:00,"It starts off weak, improving if others push it and always tailoring its work to an intended"
19:06,audience.
19:08,the social theory of reasons can even explain the existence of biases that otherwise make
19:14,little sense.
19:15,"For example, it would seem that in coming to conclusions about the world, it would behoove"
19:20,an organism to pay particular attention to information that went against what it believed.
19:25,"That way, they would be able to adjust their beliefs making them truer, more general, and"
19:30,more complete.
19:32,"To a certain extent, that IS what happens … but not always."
19:35,When someone “does their own research” they often come to the very conclusion they
19:41,wanted after all.
19:42,"When a person strongly believes that our impact on the planet isn’t a problem, they tend"
19:43,to gravitate towards reasons it might not be and see such reasons in all kinds of data.
19:44,"This is called the CONFIRMATION BIAS: our tendency to look for, prefer, and interpret"
19:50,information so that it confirms what we already think.
19:54,"It frustrates our ability to accept new, inconvienent data and is a problem for the intellectualist"
20:01,view of reason.
20:03,"If reason is for finding truth and making better decisions, why would it have this major"
20:08,weakness?
20:10,"Because, the social theory says, reasoning is a GROUP ACTIVITY."
20:16,"If I think that option A is true and the best, and you think option B is true and the best,"
20:24,"if we both researched BOTH options and sifted through reasons in support of BOTH options,"
20:30,"we would both have twice the work to do than we would if, instead, I simply came up with"
20:36,"reason for why I was right, and you attended to reasons for why YOU were right."
20:41,The confirmation bias at least HALVES the cognitive work that must be done.
20:46,Now sometimes a lone reasoner will have a bad idea.
20:52,Or a decent idea with some bad parts.
20:55,The reasons they have to justify and argue for it will be suffiencent for them and those
21:01,who intuitively agree but may be weak.
21:04,"But subjected to deliberation, put forth into the machine of collective thought, it can"
21:09,"be evaulated and judged not by one mind or a group of minds thinking alike, but by something"
21:16,special … the crowd.
21:20,Humans have long known of the WISDOM OF THE CROWDS: the phenomenon by which a collection
21:25,of many people can process information into a conclusion better than any one person could
21:30,do alone.
21:31,"It’s why we don’t trust big decisions to a single person, no matter how educated"
21:36,or powerful they are.
21:38,"Instead, we ask a group of to deliberate."
21:42,To reason together.
21:44,"In this way, the biases and errors of each is smoothed out and the decision wiser."
21:49,"In a famous example, it’s been repeatedly shown that if you ask a bunch of people to"
21:54,"guess how many jelly beans are in a jar, you’ll find that the average of all of their answers"
22:00,is CLOSER TO THE REAL NUMBER than any one individual was alone.
22:04,Even the smartest individual.
22:05,"What happens is that although some people may guess a number way too big, that mistake"
22:11,is balanced out by the fact that others will inevitably guess a number way too small.
22:17,"All together, their disagreement evens out into spectacular accuracy."
22:24,We have now arrived at the problem.
22:28,Reasoning evolved to be used socially where many different perspectives had to all deliberate
22:34,towards a common conclusion.
22:37,Such contexts are becoming less and less common.
22:40,"And it is becoming easier and easier to simply be a lone reasoner, justifying only a particular"
22:46,viewpoint without doing the harder work of deliberating and acting.
22:52,"The internet gives voices to more perspectives than ever before in our history, but it also"
22:57,makes it easy to disengage from accountability and find places where everyone believes what
23:03,you do.
23:04,"Furthermore, because of technology, we confront more issues more rapidly than ever before"
23:10,that we’re expected to have opinions about.
23:13,And the growing complexity and specialization of the modern world makes it difficult for
23:18,each of us to have well-informed prepared reasons for the acceleraeting accretion of
23:23,intutions we must form.
23:24,"in response, we look for lone reasoners who can defend our intuitions for us."
23:29,"They reasons they give don’t need to be good, just good ENOUGH that we can feel like"
23:34,justification exists.
23:36,"In the past, unconvincing reasons had to be painted on sandwich boards."
23:42,"But now, the democritization of communication means that even unpopular, unconvincing, nonsensical"
23:48,ideas can be presented with the same trust-inducing typefaces and professional look as common
23:55,ones.
23:56,"Those who disagree may challenge the reasons you’ve been given, show them to be contradictory,"
24:00,"and produce betters ones for THEIR side, but to what end?"
24:04,It’s all preparation for a debate that never comes.
24:08,You play a very small role in deciding how society is run.
24:13,Even if a good faith discussion between a representative slice of America came to a
24:18,"resolution, if nothing can come of it, why not just throw shade and sick burns or revel"
24:24,in the pleasure of reasoning by treating everything like a big giant puzzle?
24:29,"It's easy to think that it doesn’t matter, because after all, those in charge, the brilliant"
24:35,"scientists and powerful billionaires, will surely come to our rescue."
24:40,Some giant TECHNOSALVATION is surely on the horizon.
24:46,Perhaps it is.
24:48,But everything we know about reason suggets that those implementing it should be held
24:53,accountable by as many different perspectives as possible.
24:58,"Leaders could lead deliberations and be elected for their ability to moderate social reasoning,"
25:04,but that’s boring!
25:05,Why lead when you could follow: look at what some people believe and generate reasons for
25:10,"why they’re right, and they’ll love it!"
25:13,"Of course, the hard work — the REAL work — the work that truly elevates us on this"
25:18,"planet, is not in telling poeple that they’re right, but in trying to convince others and"
25:24,"in so doing, use reason as it evolved to be used."
25:29,The future of reason may in fact be the past of reason.
25:35,"In practice, what does all this look like?"
25:38,Some researchers have gone so far as to recommend national deliberation days where citizens
25:44,celebrate by literally joining small groups and talking through their opinions and comparing
25:49,reasons.
25:51,"Tests of such strategies have shown that a return to the small, targeted discussions"
25:56,our reasoning abilities evolved to excel in leaves all participants with a greater understanding
26:02,"of not just what they believe and why, but about decisions that could actually be made"
26:07,and actions that could be taken.
26:10,"Others have gone even further, recommending that the true future of reason at its best"
26:16,is the construction of a lottocracy.
26:19,"A form of government where decisions are made not by elected leaders, but by people literally"
26:26,chosen at random.
26:28,"We decide the fate of a person this way, why not the fate of the people?"
26:34,"What IF decisions were made not by politicians alone, but at least occasionally by groups"
26:40,"of actual citizens representing differences in thought, not just geography, who were brought"
26:45,together and paid for their time to learn from experts and then deliberate on an assigned
26:51,"issue until a conclusion was reached or, at the least, a recommendation?"
26:56,"Instead of being motivated by re-election, money, attention, and power, individuals chosen"
27:02,at random would have only their conscious to guide them.
27:06,Special interests and corporations wouldn’t be able to cozy up to those likely to be elected
27:11,"— if any one of us could some day serve, they’d have cozy up to and protect … all"
27:19,of us.
27:20,Instead of the learning and deliberation being done by people you never meet with offices
27:25,"in buildings you can’t access, gradually, over time, more and more of your very own"
27:30,neighbors would have had the honor.
27:33,People chosen at random would obviously lack the same celebrity status and mandate that
27:39,elected leaders cultivate and achieve — and iconic figures we relate to aren’t bad — but
27:46,our understanding of reasoning is making it more and more clear that we evolved not to
27:50,"be leave thinking up to a few great minds, but to the authorty of THE great mind."
27:57,The lumbering organ of thought that is everyone and everything.
28:03,"This is, in fact, how democracy first worked: lotteries were used to fill many political"
28:08,positions in Anceint Athens.
28:10,Aristotle explained that
28:12,"“the appointment of magistrates by lot is thought to be democratic, and the election"
28:17,of them is oligrchic”
28:19,where an oligrachy is government by only a small number of people.
28:25,"Regardless of HOW reason is brought back to its social roots, if we can build more and"
28:30,better areanas for deliberation and use them to apply reason properly to hyperobjects like
28:36,"the impact of emissions on the planet, we’ll have taught one heck of a lesson to people"
28:41,"a hundred, a thousand years into the future."
28:44,"I like to think that although widening participation will be difficult, it might provide us all"
28:51,with a kind of existential security.
28:54,The impact of emission on our planet is not going to be the last hyperproblem we face.
29:00,"If we can do a good job with it, maybe far in the future, when our civilization has advanced"
29:05,"to the point at which people can be quantumly re-recreated or something, they’ll look"
29:09,"back at our time and say, hey, let’s bring them all back to life."
29:16,We could use the cooperative abilities they had then.
29:19,"Ultimately, the old saying that “history is the great teacher” isn’t a bad guide."
29:26,"We will all some day be teachers ourselves because some day we will all be history, too."
29:32,we will some day be the ancients.
29:37,And we can choose what that will mean.
29:40,"And as always, thanks for watching."
