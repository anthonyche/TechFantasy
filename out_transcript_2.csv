00:06,Hey Vsauce!
00:11,Michael here.
00:15,And here.
00:18,Michael here!
00:19,hey vsauce!
00:22,what is here?
00:24,…. what is there?
00:26,what is there?
00:28,What REALLY exists?
00:30,Do waves exist or are there just things that are wavy?
00:35,When does a piece of food I’ve eaten stop being food and become me?
00:41,Do chairs exist?
00:46,Ontology is the philosophy of existence.
00:49,And chairs are what philosophers call ORDINARY OBJECTS.
00:58,"Ordinary objects are the plain old common sense things we deal with every day: spoons,"
01:04,"buckets, rocks, stuff like that."
01:07,Their existence is as obvious as possible
01:11,"but the more we try to sus out where they are, the more sus they become."
01:19,"First of all, sure, this could all be a dream."
01:24,Maybe we’ve all been hallucinating chairs all these years.
01:27,Or this could part of the simulated reality pumped into our brains while our bodies are
01:33,harvested for energy.
01:36,But underneath that skepticism there’s a deeper ONTOLOGICAL question that we need to
01:41,answer first.
01:43,"Regardless of whether this spoon is made of real atoms or simulated atoms, is it really"
01:50,possible to be “made of” something?
01:55,Take a look at these two things.
01:57,"As we all know, two minus one is … TWO?!"
02:02,There ARE two things here:
02:04,An origami crane AND a piece of paper.
02:07,"I’m kidding, of course, there’s really just one: the crane and the piece of paper"
02:13,are the same.
02:15,But watch this.
02:25,Where’d the crane go?
02:32,"If the paper and the crane were truly identical, they would share everything in common."
02:37,"But clearly they don’t: the paper can survive being unfolded, the crane cannot."
02:43,"Also, I made the crane, but I didn’t make the paper."
02:47,And the paper was around before the crane.
02:50,"For two things that are the same, they sure are different."
02:55,This relationship is called CONSTITUTION: paper constitutes the crane.
03:00,"It’s a one-to-one relationship, but there’s another kind of “being made of” going"
03:06,"on here, too."
03:08,"This paper is made not of ONE other thing, but of sextillions of things: fundamental"
03:14,"subatomic particles: electrons and quarks, or strings, or physical and virtual fields."
03:21,This many-to-one relationship is called COMPOSITION.
03:26,Philosophers call whatever it is that matter is ultimately composed of SIMPLES: a simple
03:31,"is a thing that, unlike a piece of paper, has no parts."
03:36,No substructure.
03:37,Not even a top or bottom.
03:38,"It could be the case that there are no simples, that there’s just a never-ending chain of"
03:42,smaller and smaller substructure.
03:45,Philosophers call such a reality a GUNKY universe.
03:50,If structure never ends in the other direction and everything turns out to be part of something
03:53,"bigger with no final complete composite, that’s what’s known as a JUNKY universe."
04:00,Point is: believing ordinary objects exist and are made up of smaller things is quite
04:07,common.
04:08,It’s called ontological reductionism.
04:09,It’s the position that wholes are NOTHING MORE than their parts.
04:14,But our cranes and our paper challenge that notion. it seems like being MADE OF some things IS different than
04:22,just BEING those things.
04:24,Let’’s agree on what it means to exist.
04:28,Let’s say that for something to exist is simply for there to be more than zero of it.
04:36,Pegasus exists if we mean “are there any winged horses in works of fiction and mythology?”
04:42,"And pegasus does not exist if we mean, “are there any physical, flesh-and-blood winged"
04:48,horses that evolved on Earth through natural selection.”
04:53,"okay, so if we can agree on that, then of course chairs exist!"
04:56,There’s this one right here.
04:58,I can see it and feel it and taste it.
05:03,yea. It’s dry and .. a little bit salty.
05:07,Dry and salty are what we call PROPERTIES.
05:12,Properties tell us what things are LIKE.
05:15,"For example, this slice of cheese is FLOPPY."
05:19,"By noticing and sharing properties, we can let each other know what to expect from things."
05:25,And we all more or less agree on what things there are.
05:29,"We give names to stuff and if they catch on, we put them in dictionaries with the word"
05:33,“noun” next to them.
05:36,But are all of these nouns an inventory of the universe … or an inventory of things
05:42,we MADE?
05:43,Let me put it this way: do islands exist?
05:47,"Well, it’s in the dictionary and a quick look around confirms that there are more than"
05:51,"zero islands, so yes."
05:54,Islands exist.
05:56,But what about incars?
06:00,An incar is a car that is IN a garage.
06:04,"As a car leaves a garage, an incar diminishes at the threshold until it collapses into nonexistence."
06:11,"Later, an extremely similar incar may emerge at the same threshold when the car returns."
06:18,Are there any cars in garages right now?
06:21,"If so, then incars exist."
06:25,"You might be thinking, “that’s not a thing."
06:29,you just made that up.
06:31,And it’s silly: “being in a garage” is just a property that a car can have.
06:37,Stop trying to make incars a thing.”
06:39,"Ok, first of all, I didn’t make it up, Eli Hirsch did."
06:43,"And second of all, if you think incars aren’t things, wait till you hear about islands."
06:50,An incar might just be a relation between a car and a garage but an island is just a
06:55,relation between land and some water.
06:58,"Now, “island” might be a more useful concept than “incar,” but does that make islands"
07:04,OBJECTIVELY more real than incars?
07:08,And what about trogs?
07:10,A trog is an object whose parts are a tree and whatever dog is nearest.
07:16,Here’s a picture of one.
07:18,Do you see the trog? this is its tree part and this is its dog part.
07:23,"You might be thinking, come on, how can THAT be a thing?"
07:26,The tree and the dog aren’t even connected!
07:29,well so what?
07:30,These two pieces of fabric aren’t connected and yet they’re a thing called a bikini.
07:35,"Now sure, if we cut down this tree and burn it for warmth, we wouldn’t feel the need"
07:40,to apologize to what’s left of the trog for destroying its tree part.
07:46,But maybe we should?
07:48,What if some extraterrestrials showed up and said they thought dogs and trees composed
07:54,trogs — would they be wrong?
07:57,Could we convince the otherwise?
08:01,Ontological realists believe that we could.
08:03,"That there really is a mind-independent answer to the question, “what is there?”"
08:08,People like Theodore Sider believe that the universe has “joints” and we can cut up reality
08:14,"up into objective, real things by finding them."
08:18,Ontological anti-realists disagree.
08:21,Their position is that what we think there is is just one way to cut up reality.
08:25,"It’s a good one for us and our needs, but it’s not objectively more true than any"
08:30,other.
08:31,So who’s right?
08:32,Hmm… well if these blocks compose a tower … what do they compose now?
08:43,Just because we don’t have a name for .. this.. doesn’t necessary mean that I haven’t
08:47,accidentally built something. Does it?
08:50,When DO two or more things compose something else?
08:56,Peter Van Inwagen calls this the special composition question.
08:59,In MATERIAL BEINGS he considers possible answers: maybe things compose something only when they’re
09:06,in contact.
09:07,"That’s a good thought, but it doesn’t explain how a BIKINI can be a thing."
09:11,Or why two books are still just two books when one is stacked on top of the other.
09:17,"you know,"
09:18,Maybe a certain degree of FIXATION is required.
09:22,Or a ‘melding’ … if a surgeon sewed us together and the skin healed with no seam
09:28,"and we shared the same blood supply … you know, even then it would seem wrong to say"
09:33,that we’d become some new kind of animal.
09:35,There’d still just me and you.
09:39,"But like, stuck together."
09:41,The philosophy of parts and wholes is called mereology and
09:46,Mereological Universalism is the belief that there’s an answer to the special composition question
09:51,"and the answer is this: any assortment of stuff, no matter how strange or scattered across time and space"
09:59,composes a thing.
10:01,"some pages compose these books but I don't just have two books here. Oh no, there's also a third thing"
10:06,"let's call it a ""took"" because it's parts are Two Books."
10:10,"There is also something composed of my left ear, the northern third of every brown trout in"
10:17,"England, and the Eiffel tower."
10:19,Just because it has no name and no one’s ever talked about it before just shows a lack
10:23,of intrest on our parts.
10:26,"To a universalist, eliminating some composites but not others is just too arbitrary."
10:31,We may as well accept them all.
10:35,"Eliminativism is any belief that accepts some composites, but eliminates others."
10:41,"Peter Van Inwagen, for example, believes that there are no ordinary objects, no chairs or"
10:47,shirts or shoes.
10:50,Right here there are just some simples — atoms or whatever — arragned show-wise.
10:55,There isn;t something else here called a shoe.
10:58,"But he thinks that because people believe they themselves exist, and he can’t see"
11:02,how something could believe it existed without existing in the first place to even think
11:06,"that, there must be people."
11:09,"He goes further, though, to argue that ALL living thigns exist."
11:14,"While admiting he doesn’t have any “knock-down” agruments in their favor, he mentions that"
11:18,because simples that are part of a living organism maintain the organism —
11:23,"— while shedding some members and gaining others, all while remaining individuated from"
11:28,"other organisms, unlike, say, waves of water at the moment of collision, clearly, simples"
11:35,in the act of a life must compose something.
11:39,That position is ORAGANICISM.
11:41,"It’s been called the belief that people exist, but that none of them wear clothes."
11:48,Mereological Nihilism is less generous.
11:51,It’s the belief that there aren’t any trogs or incars OR dogs or trees.
11:58,Because nothing ever composes.
12:00,The nihilist doesn’t believe that there is NOTHING here.
12:03,"There are lots of simples, but that’s it."
12:07,"That might sound puzzling: how can a bunch of fundamental particles, arranged into atoms"
12:12,and molecules that are arranged like this NOT be a chair?
12:17,That’s JUST IS what a chair is!
12:20,Good question.
12:21,Let’s call that deflationism: the belief that this is all silly and that all of these
12:27,positions are talking past each other: they all agree on what reality contains: they all
12:33,believe that there are simples here and that those simples are arranged in a chair shape.
12:39,"Since that’s just what a chair IS, they all believe in chairs."
12:43,Those who say they don’t just being weird and contrarian.
12:49,Deflationism has many supporters.
12:50,And it truly is the heart of our issue today.
12:54,"But to address it, we should first see why it would be nice if all of these parts did not"
13:01,form a chair.
13:02,"Let’s begin with over-determination: If chairs really do exist, shouldn’t they be"
13:09,able to interact with us?
13:10,"The thing is, though, everything this alleged chair can do can be described by referencing the behavior of"
13:16,simples here and any other simples that come along.
13:20,"An account of the activities of every ATOM in this room, leaves nothing"
13:25,for the chair to explain.
13:28,Composites are causally redundant.
13:32,"Believing in chairs is like believing that, while yes, the burning gas from my stove completely"
13:38,"describes why the water in a pot boils, there’s ALSO a magical invisible substance called"
13:44,boil-o that comes out of my stove that does the same thing as the flame at the same time
13:50,"and if there was no boil-o the flame would warm the water just the same, but there is"
13:54,boil-o.
13:57,Chairs are no more real than boil-o.
13:59,Composites over-determine what happens in the world.
14:04,They also lead to over-COUNTING.
14:07,"For more on that, let’s say hello to this video’s sponsor."
14:12,Hi.
14:13,I’m Michael Stevens.
14:14,You may know me from such films as ”Lady Gaga - Judas PARODY!
14:18,Key Of Awesome #42” and The Emoji Movie.
14:22,"But today, I’m here to talk to you about the Curiosity Box."
14:25,"This season, subscribers will be receiving many things, including a shirt celebrating"
14:31,"the Sherman line, a kit to find out what bacteria is growing on you, a puzzle that celebrates"
14:39,"the average color of neptune and yes, uranus, and the first ever at-home demonstration of"
14:47,impossible colors.
14:50,"And right now, if you subscribe with code BOGO, we’ll also send you our entire summer box completely free."
14:56,just pay shipping
14:58,How many THINGS will you be receiving for one ridiculously low price?
15:02,You might think 15: 8 things plus 7 things.
15:05,15:06
But don’t forget that you’re ALSO getting this entire collection and THIS entire collection.,15:12
That’s 17 things!,15:15
ORder now.,15:16
"That’s a good deal, but the ontology seemed wrong.",15:21
"If I count some parts, I shouldn’t also count the whole they compose.",15:26
"But if you believe in composite objects you MUST do this, right?",15:30
"After all, the composite exists.",15:32
"So if this chair contains, say, 100 sextillion atoms, then there are actually AT LEAST 100",15:41
sextillion and one things here: all of these atoms and also a chair.,15:47
"That seems wrong.. but wait, there’s more.",15:52
If I take a knife and scrape off a tiny part of this chair … is it still a chair?,15:59
I think most of us would say yes.,16:01
It would still be a chair even if I removed a tiny bit again.,16:05
And again.,16:06
A series of tiny innocuous removals is called a SORITES SEQUENCE.,16:13
The trouble they cause is that while it seems we must accept that each individual step doesn’t,16:19
"annihilate the chair, clearly, ENOUGH minute removals WILL eventually leave us with no",16:24
chair.,16:26
"Nothing at all, in fact.",16:27
But how can that be?,16:29
How subtracting zero over and over again EVER give a different result?,16:34
"Clearly, there must be a point at which a tiny change DOES make a difference.",16:40
"Different people might give different answers as to where that line is — but, you know,",16:46
we could just stipulate the boundaries: we could define “chair” in some extreamly,16:51
precise way.,16:53
"If we did that, if we defined the shape, function, history, and use that makes something a chair",16:58
so precisely that the even the smallest deviation would make or break its status as a chair,17:03
… how could we know if it’d done it right?,17:07
"If we called up God and said, “hey dude, watch this, see this chair?",17:13
"Okay, now we’re going to remove a single atom from it.",17:17
Ta da!,17:18
It’s no longer a chair is it?”,17:21
"Would God would be like, “pwha!",17:24
Correct! you guys nailed it.,17:26
That is exactly right.,17:28
"It was a chair before and now, in my infinite wisdom, I can confirm that that single atom",17:33
was what made the difference.”,17:38
Unless there’s some explanation for why a boundary should be drawn in a precise way,17:43
"instead of some other way, our stipulations are just arbitrary.",17:48
Ordinary objects may be unredeemably vague.,17:53
But being vague may actually be a feature of ordinary objects.,17:58
"For example, how many people is a crowd?",18:01
"10 people standing together in a huge empty park might be more of a group, but 10 people",18:07
standing further apart in a tiny waiting room will feel way more CROWDED.,18:13
"The fact that our terms depend on context, that they’re PLASTIC, make it seem less",18:18
and less like they’re describing THINGS and more and more like they’re pragmatic.,18:23
"That rather than telling what there is, they tell us to expect.",18:29
Peter Unger has pointed out that there’s at least one kind of thing that CAN survive,18:34
a sorities sequence without paradox: stuff.,18:38
If you innocuously remove pieces from something that is just “some stuff” you will still,18:45
have some stuff after each step until you reach a clear and unambiguous boundary: when,18:52
"the last piece is removed, there will no longer be any stuff.",18:57
This might show that there ARE composite objects: stuff.,19:02
"As soon as we pretend that some stuff is a THING, though, vagueness sets in.",19:08
Suddenly we’re talking about a thing that can lose parts but also can’t lose parts,19:13
"and unless contradictions can exist, words like “chair” don’t really refer to any",19:19
thing in the universe.,19:21
"Sorites seqeunces lead to other problems, too.",19:25
Like: the PROBLEM OF THE MANY.,19:29
"If removing a tiny number of atoms from this chair still leaves me with a chair, how many chairs are",19:36
here?,19:37
"I mean, there’s this one.",19:39
"And then there’s this one, which is really similar to the first but doesn't have these atoms on top of",19:48
it.,19:49
I don’t even have to remove atoms for this to be a problem.,19:51
All I have to do try to define which atoms here are part of the chair and which aren’t.,19:56
"At the atomic level, there isn’t a definite boundary.",20:00
"Near the edge, it will hard to tell whether a particular molecule is part of the moisture",20:05
in the chair or part of the ambient humidity.,20:09
"Instead of there being a single chair here, it seems like REALLY there are billions and",20:14
billions of candidates for the chair.,20:18
Which one is the chair?,20:21
"But now, suppose that instead of removing pieces like in a sorities sequences or choosing",20:26
"pieces like in the problem of the many, we instead discard pieces and replace them with",20:32
"new, similar pieces.",20:34
This is the set up to the famous SHIP OF THESEUS paradox.,20:40
Suppose I buy a boat and name it THESEUS.,20:43
"Over time, parts of the boat wear out and I replace them with brand new parts.",20:48
"After, say 10 years, I might realize that not a single part of my boat was part of the",20:53
boat on the day I bought it.,20:55
Do I now own a different boat?,20:57
Have I owned TWO boats?,20:59
But now suppose the someone has been following me all these years and has been picking up,21:04
each old part I throw out and storing them in a warehouse.,21:08
After I replaced all the original parts they take them and join them back the way,21:12
they way there were 10 years ago.,21:15
Which boat is THESEUS?,21:17
Both?,21:18
"If we conclude that ordinary objects don’t exist, the problems of sorites, the many,",21:26
"theseus, over-determination, and over-counting all evaporate.",21:31
"If there are only simples and they never compose anything, then which one is the ship of theseus",21:38
is easy to answer: neither!,21:41
Neither are the boat and nothing ever was the boat.,21:44
All that happened was that some simples got moved around.,21:48
"The simples the scavenger has are the simples I possessed when I bought the boat, but there’s",21:53
no mystery of persistence: removing or exchanging a piece of stuff never left me with the same,21:59
stuff.,22:00
There’s no mystery as to which of the billions of chair candidates here is THE chair and,22:08
the removal of no specific atoms will ever stop it from being a chair because it there,22:12
is no chair here and there never was.,22:15
There are only simples arranged chair-wise.,22:20
The illusion that there ARE composites that can survive changes in parts is an artifact,22:26
of our minds.,22:27
"It’s a helpful one that allows us to track certain properties and ignore others, but",22:33
"when taken seriously, it obviously isn’t really how the universe works.",22:38
And that’s okay.,22:39
We shouldn’t be embarassed when we talk about boats or chairs.,22:43
Our words for ordinary objects really do refer to actual phenomena and therefore are more,22:49
"correct than believing that, say, the sun turned into a black hole yesterday.",22:55
"Unlike the false statement that chairs exist, there is NO evidence saying the sun turned",23:00
into a black hole yesterday could even be INCORRECTLY describing.,23:04
"Because of this, Trenton Merricks calls the belief in ordinary objects false but, “nearly",23:10
as good as true.”,23:14
"This is all silly, though, right?",23:16
Of course there are chairs.,23:19
"If you believe that there are some simples arranged chair-wise, then you admit that there’s",23:24
a chair!,23:25
Because that’s just what a chair IS.,23:27
It’s not some additional THING over-and-above these simples: it just IS them.,23:33
"Each is still an atom or electron or whatever, but TOGETHER they are a chair.",23:39
"Not so fast there, chair-lover.",23:41
23:42,What do you MEAN “a chair IS simples arranged chair-wise?”
23:47,the phrase “simples arranged chair-wise” just picks out these simples.
23:52,There’s nothing else for that phrase to refer to.
23:55,There aren’t all of these simples and then ALSO some OTHER simples that are the simples
24:00,arranged chair-wise.
24:02,So do you mean that “chair” is a disguised plural?
24:06,That it refers to lots of things like the phrase “these books”?
24:11,Because “these books” only commits us to the existence of this book and this book
24:16,but not an additional single object that’s called a “these books.”
24:20,"Likewise, if “chair” just means this simple and this simple and this simple, then it points"
24:27,to a whole bunch of things and not one of them is a chair.
24:33,"Sure, “chairs” exist if by chair we mean a word for all these simples."
24:39,"But if by chair we mean an actual object in the universe, there just aren’t any, my"
24:46,friend.
24:47,"Except… maybe there is no chair over-and-above the simples, but instead something happens"
24:53,when an assortment of simples are arranged into a chair-shape.
24:57,"Each member continues to be a single atom or whatever, but COLLECTIVELY they all simultaneously"
25:04,BECOME one thing: a chair.
25:07,"Okay, so then either there’s no chair here, just simples; or somehow a miraculous contradiction"
25:14,"has appeared: many things and ALSO one thing that, despite both clearly differing in that"
25:20,"respect, are still identical!"
25:24,It looks like chairs can’t be identical to the parts they’re supposedly composed
25:28,of..
25:30,but chairs also can’t be DIFFERENT from their composite parts because there’s nothing
25:34,"else there and, after counting and accounting for their parts, there’s nothing left for"
25:40,the existence of a chair to cause or explain.
25:45,"To rescue chairs from non-existence, we need to find a way to show that a chair is independent"
25:52,of its atoms — and therefore distinct from them — but not SO distinct that it’s impossibly
25:58,over-and-above them.
26:00,We need to find a way to make chairs ONTOLOGICALLY INNOCENT.
26:05,"To have our cake and not have it, too."
26:08,Amie Thomasson does this in a very clever way.
26:11,"She points out that if I ask you, “hey, is there anything in the fridge?” and you"
26:16,"open it, see that’s it empty, and say, “there’s nothing in here” it would be weird if I"
26:21,"came over, looked inside, found a single eyelash in the corner and said, “ummm EXCUSE me?"
26:29,"What is this?! you said there was no THING in the fridge, but there was an eyelash and,"
26:35,"gosh dangit, the whole things is actually FULL!"
26:38,Of AIR.”
26:40,"That would be weird because when I asked if there was anything in the fridge, it was implied"
26:44,that I meant anything TO EAT.
26:48,"By arguing that the empty fridge is not REALLY empty, I was using the word “thing” in"
26:53,what Thomasson calls a “neutral sense.”
26:56,I used it to mean any and all entities that could possibly be described.
27:01,But you took me to be using “thing” in what she calls a “sortal” sense.
27:07,A sortal is a term that tells us what a thing is in way that allows us to count how many
27:12,there are AND know when there is or isn’t one.
27:16,“Water” is not a sortal.
27:18,"If I told you there was water in my basement and you asked, “how many waters?”"
27:22,I’d have to use a sortal to answer you.
27:25,"For example, “gallons of water.”"
27:27,Thomasson argues that the neutral use of “thing” is meaningless when used to ask questions.
27:33,"For example, if I used thing in a neutral sense and asked how many orange things are in this video"
27:40,you would have no idea how I wanted you to carve it all up
27:43,"thus, there would be no would be no single correct answer."
27:46,"You might say, ""uh, one orange thing? Your shirt?"""
27:50,"But then I could say, “what, no there's my left sleeve, my right sleeve, the inside of the shirt, the outside of the shirt. Come on, there's way more than one."""
28:00,"Unless we use a sortal net, any search for what things there are will end in confusion."
28:06,"Not because there are no things, but because it hasn’t been made clear what conditions"
28:10,to apply when searching.
28:13,"For Thomasson, this means that what we find depends on what APPLICATION CONDITIONS we"
28:19,use.
28:20,If I ask if there’s anything here that the condition “smaller than a molecule” applies
28:25,"to, you could note each such thing and give me an inventory."
28:30,“Chair” would not be on the list.
28:33,"But if I asked you if there were any medium-sized rigid-acording-to human strength things here,"
28:39,"“chair” would probably go on your list, and no single atom would."
28:44,"If an application condition is satisfied in the wrold, then the thing is descrbes exists."
28:51,So CHAIRS do exist.
28:55,"If the application conditions for one thing are also sufficient for something else, then,"
29:00,"if we find the first thing, we have found the other because it’s existence is entailed"
29:05,"ANLYTICALLY by the existence of the first thing — that is, by meaning and logic alone."
29:12,"For example, if I say that I live in a house you can conclude — without looking! — that"
29:16,I live in a building.
29:17,"There’s no paradox here, I don’t live in a house AND a building — two distinct"
29:23,things that defy the laws of physics by being co-located.
29:25,"Instead, the conditions that apply to a house are also sufficient for building."
29:32,So a single chair is not impossibly identical to some collection of many.
29:38,Nor is it somehow over-and-above its parts.
29:41,"Instead, atoms arranged chair-wise merely logically ENTAIL a chair."
29:47,The entailment connects things differentiated by distinct application conditions.
29:52,"When we ask which one is the ship of theseus, a puzzle erupts because we’re being too"
29:58,neutral.
29:59,"We need to say what we mean by “ship of theseus”: if we mean the original parts,"
30:04,then this is it.
30:05,Do we mean the thing registered to me by the boat authorities?
30:08,well then it’s this one.
30:10,“But which is the REAL one” is an incomplete pseudoquestion.
30:14,"When it come to sorites sequences, I think we need to just stipulate where the boundary"
30:20,is.
30:21,I don’t think there’s an objective answer provided by the universe or God as to exactly
30:26,"what is and isn’t a chair, but that doesn’t HAVE to mean that there aren’t any chairs,"
30:31,it can just mean that every single collection of simples is it’s own unique object independent
30:38,of our minds and that we get to decide which we will call chairs.
30:43,Vagueness comes from our minds and our language but there are no vague objects in the universe.
30:50,"We don’t have to believe that our reality is simulated, but I do think we have to believe"
30:57,that it’s stipulated: it is a reality that contains not what intelligent machines have
31:02,"decided to give us, but what we have decided we have."
31:07,There’s no fact of the matter as to whether calling this a star is the TRUE way to carve
31:13,up this stuff.
31:14,"It’s a pretty useful way to do it, and helpful for at least human purposes, but “STAR”"
31:20,is a thing WE imposed on the world.
31:24,"As Michael Jubien puts it, “there are no things, but as a consequence there are as"
31:29,many things as we like.”
31:32,"As for the problem of the many, we can simply just admit that there really are billions"
31:37,of slightly different chairs here.
31:40,"Some include a few boundary atoms that others don’t, but since they all act and react"
31:45,"pretty much in unison, in our daily lives it doesn’t matter which exact material collection"
31:51,we mean when we say “this chair.”
31:53,"However, let’s go back to our cranes."
31:59,When we talked about holes we said that holes might be ONTOLOGICALLY parasitic.
32:04,That their existence seems to require the existence of something ELSE: something that
32:09,can HOST the hole.
32:12,"Perhaps this crane is holey, too."
32:16,"Not a physical thing in its own right, but a disturbance IN some paper."
32:21,"There is no material crane here, there is only some paper that is arranged crane-wise."
32:26,"But once we start entertaining that notion, we realize that nearly EVERYTHING we see and feel"
32:31,all ordinary obejcts and even ourselves are ontological parasites
32:38,Michael Jubien calls our tendency to think that what is true of a “chair” is true
32:42,of the material that is chairing OBJECT FIXATION or PROPERTY REPRESSION.
32:49,"Object fixation is useful and “nearly as good as true” but when paradxoes loom, we"
32:55,"should remember that while chairs exist, they aren’t made out of matter and can’t be"
33:01,touched or or felt or tasted.
33:04,All I can do is taste some stuff while it chairs.
33:08,"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it’s not a"
33:14,"duck, but it is arranged duck-wise."
33:18,"I think that the only concrete physical things in our universe are simples — or, since"
33:25,our universe could be gunky — the material world only contains stuff.
33:31,"And yes, this stuff is chair-ing, but the road paved by the idea that that makes this"
33:37,stuff A chair leads to paradox.
33:41,"To see how we could have made that mistake, let’s remember the famous Clintonian dictum"
33:45,that often “it depends on what the meaning of “is” is”
33:51,"There’s the “is” of predication, which tells us what some thing is like, as in, this"
33:57,cheese IS floppy.
34:00,And then there’s the “is” of identity which tells us what is the same as what for
34:05,"example, 2+2 IS 4."
34:09,To believe that chairs are made of matter — to be believe that YOU are made of matter
34:14,— is to confuse these two ISes.
34:18,When a collection of properties are extremely thorough in telling us what to expect from
34:22,"some stuff, we tend to just go ahead and NOUN them: collapse them into a single word and"
34:28,"believe it doesn’t just describe some stuff, but REFERS to it."
34:34,I think we have an intuitive sense of the thoroughness of properties and this can be
34:38,seen in how we order our adjectives.
34:41,“Big” can mean many things.
34:44,A big diamond and big house are very different in size.
34:49,"“Blue” tells me a bit more about what to expect, but CHEESEBURGER, oooh that’s"
34:55,specific.
34:56,"So specific, in fact, that we call it a noun."
35:00,This increasing thoroughness may be partly responsible for the fact that “big blue
35:05,"cheseburger” sounds fine, but blue big cheeseburger” sounds kind of weird."
35:12,"When we embrace the idea that cheseburgers are not physical objects, but instead, exist"
35:18,"as an abstract set of properties like juicy, warm, soft, and so on, the specter of ontolgical"
35:25,paradox dissipates.
35:28,You and I are not physical objects either.
35:32,“Michael-ing” is a bunch of different properties and most of them are very vague.
35:37,"They include things like, “knowing who Kevin is, being more or less a certain height, having"
35:43,a roughly continous relationship with the stuff that Mcihaeled yesterday and that that’s
35:46,Michael-ing today” and so.
35:48,"Some of what it means to Michael does concern composition, like, the fact that I will still"
35:54,exist even if I shave off the stuff I call my beard.
35:58,"If I shaved off my beard, there would still be some stuff Michael-ing, but it would be"
36:03,different stuff than before.
36:05,"We’re able to lose parts and change and grow because we aren’t made of matter, we’re"
36:15,hosted by matter.
36:16,There’s no thing that is you and no thing that is ME.
36:18,"As Alan Watts would say, the universe doesn’t contain people, the universe PEOPLES."
36:24,"Chairs and tables and rocks and buckets and people are not made of atoms, they are preformed by atoms."
36:33,We are disturbances in stuff and none of it is us.
36:40,This stuff right here is not me. It's just me-ing.
36:44,"We are not the universe seeing itself, we ARE the seeing."
36:50,"I am not a thing that dies and becomes scattered, I AM death and I AM the scattering"
